               <h2>Smart Market Design.</h2>
               <h3>I work at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, AI and economics, with a focus on solving practical problems using simulations and stochastic optimization. 
            </h3>
            <fieldset></fieldset>
            <p>  I'm a 3rd year PhD student from <a href="https://www.gs.tum.de/en/adone/start/">AdONE</a>  (Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy) , a training community targeting at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and management science, at the Technical University of Munich, in Germany. I got my master degree from the <a href="http://gpes.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">University of Tokyo</a>, Japan and spent years as a research assistant in <a href="https://www.jst.go.jp/erato/kawarabayashi/english/index.html">National Institute of Informatics</a>, Japan. Therefore, I have some background in theoretical computer science and applied economics. I have a deep interest in utilizing mathematical modeling and computing techniques (and AI) to design mechanisms, policy/data analysis, and development to markets (though not limited to).</p>
                <p>
                    My research is currently supported by Prof. Dr. Stefan Minner <a href="https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/log/team/minner/">Prof. Dr. Stefan Minner</a> 
                    (TUM School of Management, TUM, currently Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-production-economics">IJPE</a> )
                     and <a href=" https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/bichler-martin">Prof. Dr. Martin Bichler</a>(Department of Informatics, TUM.).
                      Meanwhile I am cooperating with <a href="Department of Mathematics, Keio University, Japan">Prof. Dr. Naonori Kakimura</a>, 
                      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=yayHghEAAAAJ">Stefan Kober and Martin Bullinger</a> extensively. 
                      I enjoy talking to people in academia or industry to find out how to better optimize this amazing world. I am very interested in market design that can be applied in practice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of research, I also have my own media channels (<a href="https://space.bilibili.com/60614881">Bilibili</a>, <a href="https://weibo.com/u/3518860472">Weibo</a> ) at some largest video-sharing websites in China. Sometimes I do vlogs to record my life, but I'm more interested in spreading more knowledge about operations research in practice.

                <strong>Note to prospective PhD students:</strong>  The CS department at the University of Maryland admits students to the department itself, not to an individual advisor.  However, I will do my best to respond to inquiry emails.

                <strong>Consider applying to the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">Maryland Max Planck PhD Program</a>:</strong> spend time at both MPI in Germany and UMD in the US, work with tons of great folks, and get paid more!
